> Active development has moved to Rosetta's **rosetta-resources** and **rosetta-resources-sync** artifacts (0.2.0+). See [Rosetta's module guide](https://github.com/Rasa-Novum/Rosetta_Library/blob/main/docs/MODULES.md) for more info.

<h1 align="center">Runeweaver</h1>

A simple lightweight library for modded Minecraft that allows `.json` resource files to be modified, created, or deleted at runtime through an event-based system.

This is a fork of the original [Mixson](https://modrinth.com/mod/mixson) by [Ramixin](https://github.com/Ramixin). This version has been refactored for multi-loader (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge) and multi-version (26.2, 26.1.x, 1.21.1, 1.20.1) support using [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/) to provide a stable cross-loader & cross-version API for [our mods](https://github.com/Rasa-Novum/).

## Usage
See the wiki for in-depth usage instructions and examples: https://moddedmc.wiki/en/project/runeweaver/latest/docs

Check out https://github.com/Ramixin/Mixson for more information.

The `26.1` release jars support Minecraft 26.1, 26.1.1, and 26.1.2 (`>=26.1 <26.2`); 26.2 uses separate jars. Run `.\gradlew.bat buildReleaseArtifacts` to collect the eight release jars in `build/release`. The `26.1.2` targets remain available for patch-version validation and are excluded from release collection.

### Stonecutter
- For building, use `.\gradlew.bat :[version]:build`
- For version switching, use `.\gradlew.bat "Set active project to [version]"`
  - Versions: `26.2-fabric`, `26.1-neoforge`, etc.
- For resetting version state to default, use `.\gradlew.bat "Reset active project"`

### Implementation

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rasa-Novum/runeweaver/maven/")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.rasanovum.runeweaver:runeweaver-1.21.1-fabric:0.1.0")
}
```

The optional `runeweaver-rosetta-${minecraft}-${loader}` companion provides explicit server-owned datapack asset snapshots over Rosetta. See [`docs/runeweaver-rosetta.md`](docs/runeweaver-rosetta.md) for registration and artifact details.
